<h1>Racing Checkpoint System with AI and Power-Ups</h1>
<p align="left">
  A demo game inspired by the F1 arcade game “F1 Race Stars,” which was released in 2012 for the Xbox 360 and other consoles. 
</p>

<h2>About</h2>
<p>
This project was created as part of an assignment for my game engine architecture module and involves the use of C++ and Blueprints to create a F1/Mario Kart-style experience. The AI and Power-up were mainly coded using blueprints and the checkpoint system was coding using C++.
